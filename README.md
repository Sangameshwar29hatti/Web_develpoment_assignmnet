The Measurement Configurator provides a way to visualize and interact with the distance between two points represented by two horizontal lines. The user can drag one of the lines to change the distance, and the tool dynamically calculates and displays the distance in pixels.

#Features
Draggable Line: One of the horizontal lines is draggable by the user.
Real-Time Distance Measurement: The distance between the two lines is updated in real-time and displayed on the interface.
Responsive and Simple Design: The user interface is designed to be clean and intuitive.


#Technologies Used
HTML5: Used to create the structure of the web page.
CSS3: Used for styling and layout.
JavaScript (ES6): Used for the drag-and-drop functionality and dynamic distance calculation.

#Usage
Drag the line: Click and drag the second horizontal line to adjust its position vertically.
View the distance: As you drag the line, the distance between the two lines is displayed in pixels on the right side of the container.
